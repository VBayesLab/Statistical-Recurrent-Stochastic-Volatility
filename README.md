# Statistical-Recurrent-Stochastic-Volatility (SR-SV)
Matlab code for the SR-SV model (The software package is in the final testing phase and will be published soon)

## Introduction
SR-SV is a flexible model that uses Statistical Recurrent Unit, which is a variant of Recurrent Neuron Networks (RNNs), combining with a traditionally statistical structure to capture the dynamics of stochastic volatility (SV). The SR-SV model is able to capture complex volatility effects, e.g., non-linearity and long-memory auto-dependence, overlooked by the conventional SV models, is statistically interpretable and has an impressive out-of-sample forecast performance.
